# About Me

This website shows visualizations of clinical, mutational, and their relationship with cancer gene mutation data.

In the Relationships page, a search bar is provided that can be used to search samples by their charasteristics (i.e the sample barcode, patient's gender, etc.). This will update the Variants per Sample and VAF graphs to show samples that matches the search.

The dataset used for these visualizations is from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), a project to catalogue the genomic alterations responsible for cancer. To reduce the size of the dataset, we focus on the TCGA-BRCA Project, where the primary site of cancer is the breasts.

For more information on my project or this website, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for helping out with my dissertation!
